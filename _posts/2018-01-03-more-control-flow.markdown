at previous chapter, we've seen two basic control flow block, simple and condition. For convenience's sake , we introduce two more control flow,

  Switch : depends on a condition , control flow will goto different blocks 

compared to Condition block , the destination flow can be more than 2, and condition can also be more than 2 states. for example


how many are your online friends currently ?
0: play single player RPG 
1: play two players KOF 
other condition: play WarCraft World
  

of course switch condition can be replaced by a serial conditions as following:



Switch provides more clear view of flow.

then we will introduce the most important , the core control block of computer programming :

  Loop : do something repeatedly, until a condition result is true 

for example your computer have such a loop in it :

      
      did user ask me to do something ?
          Yes-> do it
          No -> Loop again

Loop can also be constructed by simple + condition block, but in real program, almost every language provides native Loop construct, provides more clear view. I call Loop the most important construct block of computer programming because only the Loop block, can unleash the power of computer . 

With simple/condition/switch block , your logic is mapped to computer logic 1:1 , so you got acceleration factor by computer :1

But with Loop, after design a specified type workflow, computer resolve *infinite* number of problems of such type, that is infinite acceleration

This is the true power of computer.

Until now, we have learnt almost everything about programming! Surprised ? Modern programming language provides many advanced features , but the basic constructs , still follow these simple construct blocks.  With these blocks , we can use control flow graph to resolve 99% problems.


But I can not see how these control blocks can program any interesting real program, such as playing music, or 3D games ?



 picture: I learn programming to got website/ games / music
          but only got if/else/foreach

This is frequency question most people begin to learn programming, in a short word:

Any interesting things, such as video/audio/3D pictures, can be *digitalized*, that means you can represent them with "Data"
Programming languages provide ability to maintain data
Your program create corresponding data, and send them to monitor/speaker, you finally got everything.


It's just like painting , you have paper and pencil, learn how to draw lines and circles, but when you're experienced, you can paint anything you like.
programming language is just the paper and pencil. And now we're learning how to paint line and circle.
