# Welcome to comicfans's computer/programming learning page!

This is start page for anyone who want to learn computer/programming, and first question : 

  why you want to learn computer and programming from this page, instead of other ways ? 
  
Of course you can follow university course by reading bunch of books , but I'm pretty sure most time you may got into such situation:
![before and after you decide to learn programming](/images/2018-01-01-computer-tutorial-index.markdown/before_and_after_decide_to_learn_programming.png)

Most computer/programming books are *accurate*, but also *boring*. They should be called as "Standard" or "Reference", but not "Tutorial". I'm pretty sure reading my pages is much easier than that, Because my name is comicfans ,so my learning tutorial is just a comic book, learning computer/programming is just as easy as reading comics!


Why this tutorial is called "Computer/Programming" learning ? As a self-education programmer, I've read some books on computer/programming topic , but found none of them teach computer/programming as a "whole system", you got many "Knowledge Points" after reading, but it's still not easy to link them up as a "Knowledge System", it's just like this :

![combine detail painting skills together](/images/2018-01-01-computer-tutorial-index.markdown/combine_eye_nose_mouse.jpg)

Most Computer/Programming books have very detail description for every language construct block , but that's not easy to take a quick start. You just learning so many concepts, which have little meanings until you can program and use them. Painting comics is completely different , you may have following progress when painting a comic scene:

![painting progress](/images/2018-01-01-computer-tutorial-index.markdown/painting_process.jpg)

Even you haven't paint the detail of eye before, you can still got a inaccurate , overall composition firstly. Follow this progress ,you clearly know the goal of every detail you're adding on. And you can always overwrite inaccurate parts with more accurate ones. So with my tutorial , I'll reorder the Computer/Programming knowledge as comics painting, you're not reading a reference manual with many individual Knowledge point ,but a progressive improving knowledge system.


Another improvement of my tutorial is 

Easily find what you want to learn

If you haven't too much computer knowledge before or prefer to follow my tutorial's thinking , you can read chapter by chapter just like traditional book. 


But if you have some basis already, you can just find what you want to read with "knowledge graph game", any chapter requires some sort of "skill points" to unlock and you must fit this requirements to view chapter. Finish chapter will gain the skill points. For that you can quickly skip what you've already known, and find what you want to read.

OK, Let's GO!
