Welcome to comicfans's computer/programming learning page!

This is start page for anyone who want to learn computer/programming, and first question : why you want to learn computer and programming from this page, instead of other ways ? Of course you can follow university course by reading books , but most time you may got such situation:
![before and after you decide to learn programming](/images/2018-01-01-computer-tutorial-index.markdown/before_and_after_decide_to_learn_programming.png)

I'm pretty sure reading my pages is much easier than any other's ! Because my name is comicfans ,so my learning tutorial is just a comic book, learning computer/programming is just as easy as reading comics!


Why this tutorial is called "Computer/Programming" learning ? As a self-education programmer, I've read some books on computer/programming topic , but found none of them teach computer/programming as a "whole system", you got many "Knowledge Points" after reading, but it's still not easy to link them up as a "Knowledge System", it's just like this :


Painting comics is completely different , if you want to draw a comic scene, you should follow such progress:




So with my tutorial , I'll reorder the Computer/Programming knowledge as comics painting, you're not learning a single Knowledge point ,but a System.


You can read this tutorial by two ways, one is chapter by chapter , just like traditional book. If you like step by step learn , you can follow the main index. Another one is knowledge graph system based . It's just a game,  any chapter requires some sort of "skill points" and you must fit this requirements to view chapter. Finish chapter will gain the skill points.
