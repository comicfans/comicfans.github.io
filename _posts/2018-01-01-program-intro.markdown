for some people computer seems to be Voodoo, how can you control it to do almost anything for you ? Well actually before you have written even one line of code , you have been a programmer before, don't believe that ? Can you tell me the result of 89 + 64 ? Well it's 153, but how did you got this ?

well almost everyone got this forumla:

With this method, you can calculate sum of any two integers, no matter how long they are, even you can only tell sum of any two numbers less than 10.

picture too easy ,don't leave 


Actually, you have not only written a program, but also acted as a computer to execute your own program. So let's take a look into this:

  Sum of any two number less than 10, which you already know , invariant ,predefined, This is called *builtin rules*

  Using builtin rules, Continuously adding one digit,  until no more digits left. This is called *procedure*, we created a "plus procedure" in previous example

Now everything setup , you execute the procedure with two numbers: 

  89 and 64 , this is called *input*

  Procedure applied on these input , gives back to you : 153, which is called *output*

*This is just programming* . Computer programming works exactly the same way. It has some builtin rules predefined, and the whole progress you send your procedure to computer, is just called :

   Programming

Computer can not understand human language like "continuously adding one digit until no more digit left", you must speak a language which it can understand , so the language you provided your procedure , is called 

   Programming language

There're many programming languages existed (with more developed every day) for different purpose , If language itself hide many low-level computer hardware detail for you, It's called :

   High Level Programming Language.

As the Opposite , if language itself expose many low-level computer hardware detail to you, it's called:

   Low Level Programming Language.

High Level Programming Language provides many Out-Of-Box function which can boost your productivity , and most of them are more naturally to English speaking than low level ones .but I don't recommend newcomers learn them because it's not a "System" learning, but just a "Language" learning. Since this tutorial is intend to learn computer as a System, we need a language low level enough to know how system works underline , but still easy to understand and learn. I choose 
  
   C Language 

As basis of my tutorial , it has born for a long time, seems not as cool as some new languages, but from my perspective, it's still the best choice to learn the computer. And don't worry about missing cool features from others, keeps in mind that:

  Language is just tools, only the *Logic* behind the Language is important.

When you've learn the basis part of this tutorial, we'll introduce more languages , and you suddenly find you can learn new languages in days, hours , or maybe minutes!
